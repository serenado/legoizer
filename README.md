# legoizer

Final project for 6.179 (Introduction to C/C++)
Collborator: Juan Ortiz

This is a C++ script turns an image into a "Lego mural". It takes in any PNG as an input, scans through each pixel, and converts the color of the pixel into a Lego color (i.e. colors of pieces sold by Lego). The script outputs an instruction list of the total number of Lego studs necessary of each color and produces a PNG of the original image with every pixel translated to Lego color.
